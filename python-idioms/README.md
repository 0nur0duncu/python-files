# Python Idioms Examples

This repository contains several Python scripts, each demonstrating a different Python programming idiom. Below is a brief explanation of each idiom along with examples:

## idiom_1.py

Description: Checking if the script is executed directly or imported as a module.

## idiom_1.1.py

Description: Importing and calling the `main` function from another script.

## idiom_2.py

Description: Checking conditions using boolean values and lists.

## idiom_3.py

Description: Demonstrating good and bad practices for iterating over lists and dictionaries.

## idiom_4.py

Description: Swapping values using tuple unpacking instead of using a temporary variable.

## idiom_5.py

Description: Building strings using the `join` method instead of concatenation in a loop.

## idiom_6.py

Description: Using try-except block to safely convert a string to an integer.

## idiom_7.py

Description: Enumerating items in a list.

## idiom_8.py

Description: Using list comprehension to filter and transform elements in a list.

## idiom_9.py

Description: Creating a dictionary from two lists using the `zip` function.

## idiom_10.py

Description: Iterating over key-value pairs and using a while loop with a break statement.

## Important Notes

Avoid using wildcard imports (`import *`) as they can lead to namespace pollution and make the code harder to understand.
