# Process Scheduler Simulation Report

## Introduction

This report presents the results of a process scheduler simulation. The simulation was conducted using Round Robin and FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) scheduling algorithms.

## Simulation Parameters

- Total Number of Processes: 3000
- Round Robin 1 (RR1) Queue Quantum Time: 8 units
- Round Robin 2 (RR2) Queue Quantum Time: 16 units
- Round Robin 1 (RR1) Queue Percentage: 60%
- Round Robin 2 (RR2) Queue Percentage: 30%
- FCFS Queue Percentage: 10%

## Results

### Round Robin 1 (RR1) Queue

- Average Waiting Time: [Average Waiting Time RR1]
- Average Turnaround Time: [Average Turnaround Time RR1]

### Round Robin 2 (RR2) Queue

- Average Waiting Time: [Average Waiting Time RR2]
- Average Turnaround Time: [Average Turnaround Time RR2]

### FCFS Queue

- Average Waiting Time: [Average Waiting Time FCFS]
- Average Turnaround Time: [Average Turnaround Time FCFS]

## Conclusion

This simulation examines the performance of different process scheduling algorithms. The results demonstrate the expected performance of the scheduling strategies.
